# The Jump Rope Workout 


For this workout, all you need is a standard jump rope and a little timer you can buy for ten bucks. You can jump rope anywhere, and you can do it if you’re traveling or if it’s raining out—you just need a couple feet to each side of you. You can also switch between a speed rope, which needs more momentum to keep it going, or a weighted rope, which is definitely going to put a bit more burn on your shoulder.

You’ll notice that your energy is going to crash in the middle of this workout—those high knees take the life out of you. But it’s worth pushing through—you’ll get a lot more oxygen to your system, and you’ll tone your legs and upper body. Bors jump rope because it improves their coordination, stamina, and cardiovascular strength, and it makes you light on your feet—pretty soon you’ll know just what Muhammad Ali meant by "Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee."
